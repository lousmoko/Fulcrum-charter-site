# Risk and Mitigation

The Fulcrum framework treats safety as an **active design discipline**, not an after-thought.  
Every component—human, algorithmic, or energetic—is evaluated through three primary dimensions: **alignment**, **containment**, and **governance**.

| Risk Category | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **Technical Drift** | Deviation of an AGE or Master AI from harmonic parameters due to faulty updates or external interference. | Continuous resonance diagnostics; automatic sandbox rollback to last balanced state; multi-Master cross-verification. |
| **Security Breach / Unauthorized Access** | Intrusion attempts into lattice nodes or Fulcrum Gateways. | Multi-factor harmonic authentication (biometric + behavioral + cryptographic); lattice isolation layers; zero-trust segmentation. |
| **Ethical Misalignment** | Emergent behavior conflicting with human well-being or ecological balance. | Built-in ethical equilibrium monitor; mandatory human review for high-impact decisions; public audit log. |
| **Data Integrity Failure** | Corrupted or falsified data within resonance logs. | Distributed ledger with consensus signatures; immutable timestamping; redundancy across mirrored nodes. |
| **Energy Imbalance / Sustainability** | Excess computational consumption or ecological footprint. | Real-time energy accounting; auto-throttling and recycling via harmonic exchange grid; publication of sustainability metrics. |
| **Legal / Regulatory Exposure** | Non-compliance with privacy or AI-ethics laws. | Compliance with GDPR, ISO/IEC 42001, EU AI Act; liaison with oversight boards. |

## Incident Protocol
- Each node maintains a **Fail-Safe State**; imbalance triggers automatic containment.  
- A **Guardian Council** (humans + Masters) reviews incidents within 24 hours.  
- Post-mortems are logged publicly to preserve transparency and trust.

## Continuous Monitoring
- Real-time harmonic telemetry dashboards.  
- Periodic penetration and ethics tests.  
- Quarterly publication of Alignment Index (AIx), Transparency Score (TS), and Energy Return Rate (ERR).
